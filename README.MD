# BULMA RESUME

[View Template Live](https://burkeholland.github.io/bulma-resume)

A resume template built with [Bulma CSS framework](https://bulma.io).

## Getting Started

Fork this repo and give it a proper name (i.e. "resume"). Then clone it locally and open the `index.html` file in your browser. That's it!

It's just an `index.html` file, so there isn't much to do besides edit and go. You can view the template live [here](https://burkeholland.github.io/bulma-resume).

Refer to the Bulma documentation for any questions about how to use the framework, modifiers, etc. The easiest way to change the colors on the resume is to search for `has-background` and then try replacing those values with any of the [Bulma color modifiers](https://bulma.io/documentation/helpers/color-helpers/).

## Publish to GitHub Pages

If you want to publish your resume to GitHub pages, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Push your changes to GitHub
2. Go to the repo settings and enable GitHub Pages
3. Select the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder and click Save
4. Your resume will be published to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/repo-name`

## Get a hard copy

Just print to a PDF from the browser. Make sure you do this at full desktop width. It will look great!

Send to recruiter. Get hired.
